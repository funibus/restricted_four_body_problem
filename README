restricted_four_body_problem
============================

The file restrictedFourBody.cpp compute an upperBound on the number of solutions for the restricted four body problem for masses 0.05 < m1 <= m2 <= m3, m1 + m2 + m3 = 1.
It writes in the file "inf11sol.dat" the boxes of mass space with < 11 solutions.
	  in the file "11sol.dat" the boxes of mass space with 11 solutions.
	  in the file "12sol.dat" the boxes of mass space with 12 solutions.
	  in the file "13sol.dat" the boxes of mass space with 13 solutions.
	  in the file "notGood.dat" the boxes of mass space where the algorithm fails.
	  in the file "more13sol.dat" the boxes of mass space with > 13 solutions.

To compile the code: make
You need the CAPD librairy to be able to compile it (put the path to the CAPD librairy in the makefile).

To execute the code: ./restrictedFourBody.exe
This will replace the existing files in data by new ones.

The format of the data file is such that they can be plot with gnuplot:
plot "triangleMasses.dat" with linespoint
replot "11sol.dat"
replot "12sol.dat"
replot "13sol.dat"
